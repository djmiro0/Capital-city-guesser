##Usage
The game is simple to play. First, a random city will be selected from the list of cities. The user must then place a marker on the map where they think the city is located. Once the user confirms their guess, the distance between their guess and the actual location of the city will be calculated. The user will receive points based on how close their guess is to the actual location of the city. If the user's guess is within 50km of the actual location of the city, they will receive a "Correct!" alert.

If the user's points go below 0, the game is over and an alert will be displayed.
